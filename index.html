  <h3><strong>Welcome to GooseChase Music Reviews. Check back each Sunday for new reviews and rankings.</strong>
  </h3>
  <h4><u>About us</u></h4>
  <p><strong>GooseChase Music was an idea by former musician Dan McBride (pictured below on the left), who became frustrated with the way that music journalism operated.
    After reading too many reviews that seemed to just be the author bragging about their fine taste
    and music knowledge, he decided to create a website where the reviews could be as objective as possible. No scores, just "fresh" rankings - 
    Each week the Fresh Chart will be updated to show which new albums feel the most unique and less of the same old. Sometimes, finding new music
    is a wild goose chase - but we'll guide you through.
